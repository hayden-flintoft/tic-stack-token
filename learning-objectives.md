# Learning Objectives

This project is a personal endeavour to deepen my understanding of various aspects of web and game development, using modern technologies and best practices. The key learning objectives for this project are as follows:

## Overall Objective

- [ ] **Goal:** To create a complete game using a full-stack approach, covering both front-end and back-end development.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- [ ] **Goal:** To develop a playable game between two human players without involving routes, APIs, or databases.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Implement the core game logic to handle two-player gameplay.
- [ ] Design and build the game interface using React and Material UI.
- [ ] Ensure smooth interaction between the players through responsive UI and real-time updates.
- [ ] Test the game thoroughly to ensure that all game rules are enforced correctly.

## 1. React Development

- [ ] **Goal:** To build a fully functional and interactive game interface using React.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Master component-based architecture in React to manage complex UIs.
- [ ] Learn state management techniques using hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) to maintain and update the game state.
- [ ] Implement efficient rendering strategies to optimise the performance of the game interface.

## 2. Game Logic

- [ ] **Goal:** To develop robust and scalable game logic for a tic-tac-toe-based game.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Design and implement core game mechanics, including turn-based play, win conditions, and handling draws.
- [ ] Develop reusable logic components that can be adapted to different game scenarios or extended for future enhancements.
- [ ] Test game logic to ensure correctness and handle edge cases effectively.

## 3. UI/UX Design

- [ ] **Goal:** To create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that enhances the player's experience.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Apply UI/UX best practices to design a clean and user-friendly interface.
- [ ] Explore and implement Material UI components to achieve a consistent look and feel.
- [ ] Ensure the game interface is responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.

## Stretch Goal: AI Player

- [ ] **Goal:** To build an AI player that can compete against a human player.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Implement basic AI algorithms to simulate an opponent.
- [ ] Explore strategies for making the AI player challenging but beatable.
- [ ] Integrate AI logic with the existing game structure to allow for single-player mode.
- [ ] Test the AI's performance and refine its strategies for better gameplay experience.

## Stretch Goal: Testing

- [ ] **Goal:** To establish comprehensive testing practices using Vitest.

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Set up and integrate V8 for code coverage analysis.
- [ ] Develop unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual components and functions.
- [ ] Implement integration tests to verify the proper interaction between different parts of the application.
- [ ] Refactor and improve code as necessary to ensure all tests pass successfully.

## Optional: React Forms (User Sign-Up)

- [ ] **Goal:** To learn and implement form handling in React, specifically for user registration (if expanded to a full-stack app).

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Merge the source code with an appropriate boilerplate.
- [ ] Create a user sign-up form that captures and validates user input.
- [ ] Learn to manage form state in React, including handling input fields, errors, and form submission.
- [ ] Integrate the form with backend services for user authentication and data storage.

## Optional: Knex with SQLite (Scoreboard)

- [ ] **Goal:** To integrate a database solution for storing and retrieving game data, particularly for a scoreboard (if expanded to a full-stack app).

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Merge the source code with an appropriate boilerplate.
- [ ] Set up SQLite as the database for the project, using Knex as the query builder.
- [ ] Design and implement a database schema for storing user scores and game history.
- [ ] Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database through Knex.
- [ ] Optimise database queries to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.

## Optional: APIs for Database Operations

- [ ] **Goal:** To create and consume RESTful APIs for interacting with the database (if expanded to a full-stack app).

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Merge the source code with an appropriate boilerplate.
- [ ] Develop backend APIs that facilitate secure and efficient communication between the front end and the database.
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for scoreboard operations, including fetching, updating, and displaying user scores.
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling, authentication, and data validation in the API layer.

## Optional: Routes for Accessing a User's Profile

- [ ] **Goal:** To implement routes that allow users to access and manage their profiles (if expanded to a full-stack app).

**Objectives:**

- [ ] Merge the source code with an appropriate boilerplate.
- [ ] Create secure routes for users to view and edit their profiles.
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorisation to protect profile data.
- [ ] Integrate front-end forms with backend APIs to update user information.
- [ ] Test the routes to ensure proper handling of user data and secure access control.
